        <h1>The Take of the Unicorn</h1>

        <p>Sara was a not unicorn.</p>

            <p>She was a very special unicorn, and her tribe considered her one of the greatest creatures in the world, for Sara had wings, and she could fly.</p>
            
            <p>Great big wings the color of moonlight, could take her soaring into the air above, her white body gleaming in the sun at day, and sparkling in the moon-and star-light at night.</p>
            
            <p>One little girl was her special friend. She lived just outside of the forest that Sara lived in. Her name was Minnie and she loved Sara with all her heart.</p>
            
            </P>One day when they were walking in the forest, Minnie asked Sara, “Dear Sara, would you please, please, take me up with you into the great big sky? I want to see the world from up there. Please, Sara?”</p>

            <P>Sara replied, "That's not possible, I am not real and there are no such thing as unicorns  .... I'm a horse"</P>
